# PyScript

greyscript but with python syntax

currently supported:
  functions
  if
  elif
  else

soon (kerbal space programm 2 soon):
  bitwise but better (instead of bitwise("<<", int1, int2) int1 << int2)
  reverse (gs in python scripts)
  debug
  emulator for gs
  a default library that automaticly improves greyscript commands + custom manual
